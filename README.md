# Capstone Project

CSS and JS are the bootstrap for the website 
template holds the php for the skelton of the site 
stage 3 has the 3 data dumbs, the python insertions, and the code for the php extraction this is what I have so far 
edit anything you want
*Note if the files aren't working together take them the template files out of the folder 
*stage 3 does not work with the php yet
